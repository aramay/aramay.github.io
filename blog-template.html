<!--Release 2: Reflect
answering the following questions

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

- It was rewarding, we got into a discussion to seperate wireframe from mockups. In general there is less distinction between the two, but we realized that mackups is a realistic representation of what the product will look like e.g colors , buttons etc.

wireframes ares simple sketch that demonstrates what sort of things you can do in your design. For example, a wireframe of a website will show the navigation, the main buttons, the columns, the placing of different elements. You can think of it as a bluprint for a website.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

- I feel wireframes helped to fill the gap between an idea and actuall implementation. There are so many details that general thought process does not capture. To sketch out your plan helps in discussion and refine your ideas and goals.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

- Focus on primary purpose and goals led to good wireframe.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

- New HTML5 elements that i learned about are
  - <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
  - <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.
  - <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.

Then, add a link to your wireframe image so your reviewers can see what it looks like.
