      <h2>
        Arrays
      </h2>
      <p>
        arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index. Ruby arrays can hold objects such as String, Integer, Fixnum, Hash, Symbol, even other Array objects.
      </p>

      <div>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/34984987a33fe64c5610.js"></script>
      </div>

      <p>
        notice that above array has strings, an integer, and a float. Arrays can have anything in them (even other arrays!).
      </p>

      <h3>
        Some Array methods
      </h3>

      <p>
        We can use Array methods to interact with this arrays. Find first element. Similarly we can use <code>.last</code> method to find last element.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/9b4502e5cf88850117dc.js"></script>

      <p>
        Arrays are what we call indexed lists. That means that each slot in an array is numbered. You can reference any element by its index number. The syntax to do this is typing the array name with the index in brackets <code>[]</code> directly following. Let's try it out.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Iterating Over an Array
      </h3>

      <p>
        Accesing each element of array manually can be curbersome, iterators provide a way to access array element in a loop

      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/a8c59f5d4ee025a004d9.js"></script>

      <p>
        We have called a "each" method on array using <code>.</code> operator. What it does is that it iterates over each element, starting from 0 .. all the way to end.

        Then it begins executing the code within the block. The block's starting and ending points are defined by the curly braces <code>{}</code>. Each time we iterate over the array, we need to assign the value of the element to a variable. In this example we have named the variable name and placed it in between two pipes |. After that, we write the logic that we want to use to operate on the variable, which represents the current array element. In this case it is simply printing to the screen using puts.

      </p>

      <h3>
        Blocks
      </h3>
      <p>
        Blocks are important part of iteration, let's take some time to go over them.ly

        By convention,we use curley braces {} - when everything can be done in one line.

        We can use do and end keyword to perform multi-line operation. Let's take a look at some examples.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/333a64b0b680ad1111a6.js"></script>

      <p>

        In the above example we added a counter 'x' after each name. The number 'x' is incremented every time we go through the iteration.

      <h2>
        Hashes
      </h2>
      <p>
        A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.
      </p>

      <div>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/4f914563918e078a2db5.js"></script>
      </div>

      <h3>
        Hash Operations
      </h3>
      <p>
        We can add and remove elements from existing Hash.
        Add elements to an existing Hash by this statement<code>person[:weight] = '65-kg'</code>

      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/859bb1a80c392d429849.js"></script>

      <p>Similarly, to remove an element from an existing Hash</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/e5dd5ce883051d87b81f.js"></script>

      <h3>
        Iterating Over Hashes
      </h3>

      <p>
        We'll use the <code>each</code> method again. This time we assign variable to both key and value. In this example we are assigning a key to 'x' and value to 'y'.
      </p>
