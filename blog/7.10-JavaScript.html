      <h2>
        JavaScript Objects
      </h2>
      <p>
        So Ruby and Javascript are fairly similar as they both use Object Oriented Programming.They can create these elements called <em>Objects</em> that represent some form of data as opposed to <em>actions</em>. This makes it much easier for the programmer to manipulate an objects data.
      </p>

      <p>
        This post in simply an overview of the differences/similarities between Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Objects in JavaScript can also be used as Hashmaps; they mainly consist of named <code>properties</code> mapping to <code>values</code>.
      </p>

      <div>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/85aaea702c15efa4c5e5.js"></script>
      </div>

      <p>
        Above example shows using an object literal - <code>{}</code> notation - it is possible to create a plain object.
      </p>

      <h3>
        JS - Accessing Properties
      </h3>

      <p>
        The properties can be accessed via two ways, either via <code>.</code> notation or using <code>[ ]</code> square bracket notation.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/262d30fa52af3eac67e6.js"></script>

      <h3>
        Ruby - Hashes
      </h3>

      <p>
        A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" => "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can create a Hash in Ruby using a literal <code>{ }</code>.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/1b999755242b01282116.js"></script>

      <h3>
        Interacting with a Hash in Ruby
      </h3>

      <p>
        Accessing keys in Hashes can be achieved via several build-in methods.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/kasper341/d5b3c26d018ee193cafd.js"></script>

      <p>
        Here in the above example, we used <code>.keys</code> to return keys in out Hash.

        Nest we used <code>.kas_key?</code> which returns <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> if Hash contains the key.

        I think remaining methods are self explanatory, if i not why not give it a try yourself.
