        Sorting Algorithms
      </h2>
      <p>
        A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search).

      <h2>Popular sorting algorithms</h2>

      <p>
        <h3>Merge sort </h3> takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. This is an example of Divide and conquer to sort complex and huge data sets.

      <p>
        <h3>Quicksort</h3>  is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a partition operation: to partition an array an element called a pivot is selected.[26][27] All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Bubble sort</h3> is a simple sorting algorithm. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass.
