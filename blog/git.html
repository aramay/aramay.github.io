   <h4>Feb-12-2016</h4>

   <section>


     <p>
        Developer can use it to achieve following goals
        <ul>
          <li>maintain different version of software</li>
          <li>revert changes </li>
          <li>easy backup</li>
          <li>more than one developer can work on project</li>
        </ul>

<h2>How does git help you keep track of changes</h2>
     <p>


         Git is a widely used “source code management system” for software development. It is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Git is like an App that runs locally on user's machine.

<ol>

  <li>Repository</li>

    <p>A repository is a special directory which has all the features of version control system. You can create a local repository by

          <ul>
            <li>create a directory</li>
            <li>type command - <b>git init</b></li>
            <li>or clone an existing repository by
            <b>git clone /path/to/directory</b> </li>
          </ul>
    </p>

  <li>Workflow</li>
    <p>
    Your local directory consist of three trees:

          <ul>
            <li>working directory - which has all the actual files</li>
            <li>add files to your repository which have been changed - <b>git add *</b></li>
            </li>actual commit would save those files in local repository - <b>git commit -m “message” </b></li>
          </ul>
    </p>

  <li>Push Changes</li>
    To send these changes to remote repository, <br>type command
    <b>git push origin <&it;branch-name></b>

</ol>

     </p>

  <h3>GitHub</h3>
GitHub is web based repository hosting service. A web based model allows multiple users to work on same project. This way all the changes are synced and developers across the globe can keep up with progress. This can be accomplished as follows.

    <ol>
      <li>Update and Merge</li>
        Developer 1 can get the latest repository by making a call <br>pull request.
        <b>git pull</b>
      <li>After making changes to his files, developer 1 can push changes, so repository is synced.</li>
      <b>git push origin master</b>
      <li>developer 2 and developer 3 can sync their local repositories by doing <br><b>git pull</b> (it will merge latest changes)</li>

  </ol>

<h3>Why use GitHub to store your code ?</h3>

<section> Version Control is a widely used “source code management system” for software development. It is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.
GitHub is a repository hosting service. It’s flagship feature is “forking”. Forking is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.</section>
