            <article>How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?
                Developer use it achieve following goals
                maintain different version of software
                revert changes
                easy backup
                more than one developer can work on project
                What is a commit?
                In version control system, a commit adds latest changes to software repository. This way when other user do any update or checkout  a project, they will receive a latest version, unless they specify they wish to retrieve a previous version of the source code in the repository.

                What are the best practices for commit messages?
                A project's long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his project's log.
                Sometimes a single line is fine, especially when the change is so simple that no further context is necessary.
                e.g “fixed typo”

                when a commit merits a bit of explanation and context, you need to write a body with Subject. e.g:
                Fixed bug#23
                Expired user were is able to create certificate. As per business requirements, this is not allowed.
                What does the HEAD^ argument mean?
                HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the current checked out branch.
                HEAD~3, HEAD~4, HEAD~5, are the 3rd 4th and 5th commit from HEAD respectively.
